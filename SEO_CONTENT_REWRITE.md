# PART 2: ROUTING FIXES

## Current Routing Structure (Vite + Wouter)

The site uses Wouter for client-side routing. All routes are handled by the SPA.

### Current Routes in App.tsx:
```javascript
<Route path="/" component={Home} />
<Route path="/packages" component={PackagesLanding} />
<Route path="/packages/:category" component={PackageCategory} />
<Route path="/destinations" component={Destinations} />
<Route path="/blog" component={Blog} />
<Route path="/about" component={About} />
<Route path="/booking" component={Booking} />
<Route path="/package/:id" component={PackageDetail} />
<Route path="/destination/:id" component={DestinationDetail} />
<Route path="/blog/:id" component={BlogDetail} />
<Route component={NotFound} />
```

# PART 3: IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

## Week 1 (Critical)
1. ✅ Add page-specific meta tags using React Helmet or similar
2. ✅ Rewrite /packages page H1 and content
3. ✅ Add schema markup to package pages
4. ✅ Add content to /booking page

## Week 2 (High Priority)
1. Add FAQ sections to all main pages
2. Expand /destinations content
3. Add breadcrumbs to all inner pages
4. Implement dynamic meta tags for package/destination/blog detail pages

## Week 3 (Medium Priority)
1. Create landing pages for key keywords (Varanasi Ganga Aarti, Ram Mandir Ayodhya Tour, etc.)
2. Add more blog content
3. Implement Article schema for blog posts
4. Add Reviews/Testimonials schema

---

# NEXT STEPS

To implement these changes, I recommend:

1. **Install react-helmet-async** for per-page meta tags
2. **Create an SEO component** that can be dropped into each page
3. **Update each page file** with the new content and SEO elements
4. **Add JSON-LD scripts** dynamically per page

Would you like me to implement any of these changes now?
