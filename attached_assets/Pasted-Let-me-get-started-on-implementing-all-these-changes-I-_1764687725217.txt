Let me get started on implementing all these changes. I'll first try to address the DNS issue and then add all the real data.


Decided on task progression focus

Searched Replit documentation for "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN server IP address not found preview not working fix"

Planned database setup and data integration (4 seconds)
I see the server is running but the database is not connected ("DATABASE_URL not set"). Let me first set up the database and then add all the real package data.


Decided on database creation strategy

Created PostgreSQL database

Planned database integration and seeding
Database created. Now let me set up the database integration and add all the real data.

Searched for "How is DATABASE_URL environment variable loaded and accessed in the application startup?"

Decided on direct SQL execution
Let me check if I can access the database directly:

Executed source /etc/profile 2>/dev/null; printenv | grep -E "^(DATABASE|PG)" | head -5

Decided on database seeding strategy
The secrets are set but showing empty values. Let me check the actual database status:

Opened server/seed.ts

Diagnosed database connection issues
The seed data already exists in the code - I see it has destinations, blogs, and packages. Let me try running the migrations manually now that the database is provisioned:

Checked system logs

Decided on frontend data improvements (5 seconds)
The database environment variable isn't being picked up yet. This sometimes requires a full Replit workspace restart (not just VM restart). Let me focus on what I can fix right now - updating the seed data and frontend to have complete package information:


Opened client/src/pages/Home.tsx

Determined secret access issue
Let me focus on the actual database connection issue. The DATABASE_URL secret exists but isn't being passed to the node process:

Checked system logs

Decided on frontend focus (7 seconds)
The DATABASE_URL secret exists but isn't being injected into the running process. This is a Replit environment issue that sometimes requires a full workspace restart (not just VM restart).

Let me update the task list and continue with what I can fix - updating the seed data with complete information and fixing the frontend to work properly with fallback data while the database issue is resolved:


Pondered asset availability for Ujjain
Opened attached_assets/generated_images directory

Generated Ujjain images (5 seconds)
I need to generate images for Ujjain since there are none in the assets. Let me create them:
