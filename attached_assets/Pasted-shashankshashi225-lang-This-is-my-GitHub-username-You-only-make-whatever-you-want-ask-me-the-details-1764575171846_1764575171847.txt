Executed pwd && ls -la

Decided on git authentication method
Perfect! I found the project. ✅ Now I need one piece of information from you:

I need to push to GitHub, which requires authentication. You have 2 options:

Option A: Use GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)
Go to: github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
Click "Generate new token (classic)"
Give it a name like: Replit Deploy
Check these boxes:
✅ repo (full control of private repositories)
✅ gist
Click "Generate token"
Copy the token (it will be a long string like ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxx)
Share it with me (it will only be used to push your code)
OR

Option B: Use SSH Key
If you already have SSH set up with GitHub, just let me know and I'll use that instead.

Which option do you prefer? Once you provide the token, I'll immediately push your entire project to GitHub! 🚀
