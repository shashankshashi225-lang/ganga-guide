annapurna-temple-varanasi	Annapurna Temple Varanasi	Goddess of Nourishment in Kashi	"The Annapurna Mandir in Varanasi, located in the lane near Visheshwarganj and adjacent to the revered Kashi Vishwanath Temple, is dedicated to Goddess Annapurna — the Divine Mother who ensures that her devotees are never deprived of food. With a golden ladle in one hand and a bowl of rice in the other, she is worshipped as the provider of nourishment and sustenance.

The name itself holds meaning: Anna means food, while Purna means fullness or completeness. As a form of Goddess Parvati, she plays an essential role in the spiritual and mythological fabric of Kashi (Varanasi).

Key Features & Administration

- The Annapurna Devi Mandir was built in 1729 A.D. by the Maratha ruler Peshwa Baji Rao I, in the Nagara architectural style.
- Within its large pillared sanctum are two idols of the Goddess: one brass, available for darshan every day, and another gold, shown to devotees only once annually on Annakut (the day after Diwali).
- The temple design follows the Panchayatana layout, meaning there are subsidiary shrines too — dedicated to deities like Ganesha, Kubera, Surya, Yantreshwar Mahadev, Satyanarayan, and Hanuman among them.

Beliefs

- One popular legend says that Parvati, seeking to restore her fair form (Gauri) after a disagreement with Shiva, was instructed by Shiva to distribute food in Varanasi. Adopting the form of Annapurna, she provided nourishment in the holy city.
- Another telling is that Shiva once declared that everything, including food, is maya (illusion). Disturbed by this, Parvati made all food vanish, causing suffering. Realizing the importance of sustenance, Shiva eventually begged Parvati at her door. Parvati then relented, feeding the world and setting up her kitchen in Varanasi.

Festivals, Rituals & Access

- Annakut (the day after Diwali) is the most important festival for the temple. On this day, the golden idol is unveiled for public worship, and special offerings (Annakut coins) are distributed to devotees.
- During Navratri (in both October and April), the temple receives large crowds for special pujas.
- The temple premises are maintained by the Kashi Annapurna Annakshetra Trust, which also runs social service activities: free food (annadaan), elderly care, medical clinics, education, and more."	/attached_assets/generated_images/varanasi-annapurna.png	null	null	null	Varanasi	false	true
durga-temple-varanasi	Durga Temple Varanasi	The Benevolent Guardian Goddess of Varanasi	"Varanasi, the eternal city, has for ages been under the benevolent protection of Goddess Durga. As the legends say, she appeared to King Subahu, the ruler of Kashi, and pledged: ""As long as Kashi stands upon the face of the earth, I, in my form as Durga, will reside here."" It was here, in this sacred place, that she defeated the demon Durga-asura (also called Durgamasura), following which she became known as Goddess Durga, protector of Kashi. (Kashi Khand of the Skanda Purana)

Legends

- Centuries ago, Prince Sudarshana of Ayodhya was exiled after his father, King Ikshvaku Dhruvasandhi, passed away. He came to Kashi's deep forested region called Ananda Vana, where he met and fell in love with Princess Shashikala, daughter of King Subahu of Kashi.
- When the time came for her swayamvara (bride's self-choice ceremony), Shashikala had a prophetic dream from Goddess Durga, who revealed that Sudarshana was her destined husband. On the day of swayamvara, Shashikala rejected all suitors, declaring by Durga's blessing that Sudarshana was her choice.
- Enraged, the other kings attacked Kashi. As the war turned against King Subahu, both Sudarshana and Shashikala prayed to Durga. A divine host of goddesses riding fearsome beasts appeared, slew the invaders, and bathed the field in the enemy's blood. Subahu surrendered before Durga, who restored Sudarshana to his kingdom and sanctified the union. (From Devi Bhagavata Purana)
- It is also believed by locals that after slaying demons Sumbha and Nishumbha, Durga rested here. The central shrine later came to be worshipped in yantra form. Some say the original murti (idol) was hidden for safety during periods of invasion.

Architecture & Significance

- The present temple complex, including the Durga Kund (a water reservoir), was reconstructed in 1760 AD by Rani Bhavani of Bengal/Natore.
- The temple's style is Nagara (northern Indian) architecture, painted in crimson-red and ochre, matching the iconography of Goddess Durga.
- The main idol is worshipped in the yantra form and identified with Kushmanda, the fourth form of Durga, sometimes described as the creator form. Alongside her are idols of Bhadra Kali (Tantric Kali), Chand Bhairava, Rudra Bhairava, Maha Lakshmi, and Maha Saraswati.
- In the outer courtyard are smaller shrines to deities including Kukkuteshwara Mahadev, Tilparneshwar Mahadev, Surya, Jwarhareshwari, Lakshmi Narayana, and Radha-Krishna

Present Day and Ritual Practices

- The temple is especially vibrant on Tuesdays and Fridays. During the Hindu month of Shravan, the goddess is adorned in various 'shringar' (ornaments and ritual decoration).
- There is an annual Durga Kund Sangeet Samaroh in Shravan/Bhadrapada (August-September), where classical musicians perform in her honor.
- The fourth day of Navratri holds special importance here, as it is dedicated to the Kushmanda aspect of Durga.

Timing & Location

- The temple is open daily, from 4:00 AM to 1:00 PM, and then from 3:00 PM to 10:30 PM.
- Located in the Kedar Khand of Varanasi, near Durga Kund and along Sankat Mochan Road, it is close to other well-known temples such as Tulsi Manas Mandir, Senapati Hanuman Temple, Kaudi Mata Temple, and of course Sankat Mochan.

Veda / Skanda Purana Connection

- The Skanda Purana contains a section called Kashi Khand, which narrates the legends of Kashi (Varanasi) including tales of Durga, her dwelling, her battles, and the importance of the goddess in guarding Kashi.
- According to the Devi Bhagavata Purana (referred in Skanda Purana/Kashi Khand or parallel Puranic tradition), the story of Sudarshana and Shashikala is established, along with the Goddess Durga intervening to protect Kashi.
- On the subject of Kushmanda, scriptures describe her as the fourth form of Navadurga. Her name is derived from Ku = little, Ushma = energy or warmth, Anda = egg, meaning ""she who creates the cosmic egg / universe"".
- Kushmanda is associated with certain mantras, offerings, and symbolisms in Puranic and devotional texts: she is worshipped on the fourth day of Navratri, depicted with eight arms, rides on a lion, holds weapons, rosary, perhaps jars of elixir, etc.
- There is also mention in Skanda Purana of the Vinayakas of Kashi (fifty-six Vinayakas) called Kūṣmāṇḍa / Kūṣmāṇḍavināyaka located in the sacred geography of Kasi-mandala."	/attached_assets/generated_images/varanasi-durga.png	null	null	null	Varanasi	true	true

kanak-bhawan-ayodhya	Kanak Bhawan Ayodhya	The Golden Palace of Sita and Ram	"In the spiritual heart of Ayodhya stands Kanak Bhawan, one of the most enchanting temples dedicated to Lord Rama and Goddess Sita. Radiating beauty, devotion, and royal charm, this shrine is often called the ""Golden Palace of Ayodhya"" for its richly adorned idols and luminous interiors.

Located near the famous Ram Janmabhoomi complex, Kanak Bhawan remains one of the most visited and cherished temples in the region—both for pilgrims and architecture enthusiasts.

A Gift of Love – The Origin of Kanak Bhawan

According to tradition, Mata Kaikeyi, the mother of Bharata, gifted this palace to Sita after her marriage to Lord Rama. This makes Kanak Bhawan one of the earliest residences of Sita in Ayodhya, symbolizing the affection and royal welcome offered to her.

Over centuries, the structure saw multiple renovations:
- King Vikramaditya is believed to have restored it during ancient times.
- The present magnificent temple was fully rebuilt in 1891 CE by Vrish Bhanu Kunwari, queen of Tikamgarh (Bundelkhand).

Her devotion resulted in a breathtaking architectural gem that stands proudly even today.

Bundelkhand Architecture — Royal, Graceful & Unique

The temple is a prime example of Bundela architectural style, known for:
- Ornate arches
- Beautifully carved pillars
- Courtyards with symmetrical patterns
- Domes with Rajasthani–Bundelkhand influence"	/attached_assets/generated_images/ayodhya-kanak-bhawan.png	null	null	null	Ayodhya	false	true

This ancient Shiva temple is woven deeply into Ayodhya's mythology, legends, and royal history—making it a serene yet powerful stop for pilgrims.

A Temple Born from a Divine Love Story

The origins of Nageshwar Nath Temple date back to the era of Kush, the son of Lord Rama. According to the legend:
- While bathing in the Saryu River, Kush lost his armlet.
- It was discovered by a Nag-Kanya, a serpent maiden, who instantly fell in love with him.
- She was a devotee of Lord Shiva, and to honor her devotion and affection, Kush established this temple dedicated to Nageshwar Mahadev.

Even centuries later, during the reign of King Vikramaditya, the temple continued to flourish.

Nageshwar Mahadev in Tradition

Many ancient texts refer to Nageshwar as a form of Shiva who:
- Grants liberation from karmic bondage
- Removes fear from serpent-related inauspiciousness
- Protects sacred lands (kshetra rakshak)

Ayodhya's Nageshwar Nath is often considered one such guardian deity, preserving the sanctity of the land of Rama.

The Temple You See Today: Built in the 18th Century

By the 18th century, the original structure needed restoration. The present-day temple was rebuilt around 1750 CE by Naval Rai, the minister of Safdar Jung, the Nawab of Awadh. The architectural style reflects a graceful blend of:
- Traditional Awadhi temple structures
- Shiva iconography
- Ornate domes and arches
- Stone courtyards facing the ghats of Saryu

Today, the temple stands as a reminder of Ayodhya's layered past—from the Ikshvaku dynasty to the Nawabs.

sankat-mochan-hanuman-varanasi	Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple	"The ""Reliever of Troubles"" of Varanasi"	"Nestled in the Lanka area on the bank of the Assi River (now reduced to a nallah), the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple is one of Varanasi's most beloved shrines. Known also among locals as the Monkey Temple for its many resident monkeys, this temple serves not only as a place of worship but as a peaceful refuge amid the bustle of Banaras.

Sankat Mochan means ""one who removes crises, troubles, and pain,"" and every month, lakhs of devotees visit seeking relief from their problems.

History & Legend

- The temple traces its founding to the 16th century when the saint-poet Goswami Tulsidas, author of the Ramcharitamanas, had a vision of Lord Hanuman at this very spot. The present temple stands where Hanuman is said to have appeared to Tulsidas.
- An old story tells that Tulsidas, disappointed at not meeting the divine, flung his water pot in frustration; it fell upon a dead tree. That event pleased a thirsty spirit, who appeared, offered him one wish, and upon hearing that Tulsidas wished to meet Lord Rama, suggested Hanuman as the mediator, because Hanuman ""never skips Ram Katha"" (the telling of Lord Rama's story).
- Over time, the temple complex was expanded. Notably, Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya contributed to its enlargement, giving it much of its present layout.

Spiritual & Cultural Significance

- Devotees flock here especially on Tuesdays and Saturdays, believing Hanuman's grace helps relieve planetary afflictions—particularly those involving Shani (Saturn) and Mangal (Mars).
- It is believed that Tulsidas composed significant portions of the Ramcharitamanas while staying within or near this temple's precincts.
- The temple also preserves a fig tree under which many verses of Ramcharitamanas are said to have been written. This tree is considered sacred.

Events, Rituals & Festivals

- Hanuman Jayanti is celebrated with processions, special prayers, and Ram Katha recitations.
- The Sankat Mochan Music Festival is a major cultural event held annually in the temple grounds, featuring classical music artists.

Today: Management & Social Role

- The temple is managed by its Mahant; currently Prof. Vishwambhar Nath Mishra is the Mahant.
- The Sankat Mochan Foundation was established in 1982 by Veer Bhadra Mishra, who was also a Mahant. This foundation works towards cleaning and protecting the Ganga among other social and environmental projects.

Veda / Purāṇa Connection

- While there is no clear citation in the Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, Atharva) that names this specific temple, the temple is deeply embedded in the Purāṇic-Bhakti tradition via Tulsidas and the Ramcharitamanas. The Ramcharitamanas is not part of the classical four Vedas, but is considered a sacred text in North India especially among Vaishnavas and Rama devotees.
- The temple's founding legend (Tulsidas's vision of Hanuman) resonates with themes common in the Bhakti movement, which borrowed from Purāṇic and Itihāsa (Ramayana) sources.
- In Purāṇas like those recounting the story of Lord Rama and Hanuman (for example, Valmiki Ramayana, Bhāgavata Purāṇa, etc.), Hanuman is repeatedly characterized as Sankat Mochan—remover of troubles—especially for devotees."	/attached_assets/generated_images/varanasi-sankat-mochan.png	null	null	null	Varanasi	true	true
treta-ke-thakur-ayodhya	Treta Ke Thakur Temple	The Sacred Seat of Lord Rama's Ashwamedha Yagna	"Located on the serene banks of the Saryu River at Naya Ghat, the Treta Ke Thakur Temple is one of Ayodhya's most revered spiritual landmarks. Dedicated to Lord Rama in his Treta Yuga form, this ancient shrine attracts pilgrims, historians, and curious travelers alike for its divine aura and powerful legends.

The temple stands at the very place believed to be the site where Lord Rama performed the Ashwamedha Yagna, one of the most significant Vedic rituals symbolizing sovereign victory and universal harmony.

A Glimpse into the Temple's Sacred History

The origins of the temple go back roughly 300 years, when the King of Kullu constructed a shrine here to honor Lord Rama. Several centuries later, the temple underwent major renovation under the great Maratha queen Ahilyabai Holkar in 1784 CE, who revived many ancient temples across India, including Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi and temples in Gaya, Indore, and Mathura.

Her contribution gave the temple its present architectural form—simple, serene, and spiritually rich.

Treta Yuga Connection – Why This Temple Is Unique

Unlike other Ram temples that celebrate the broader life of Rama, this shrine specifically worships Lord Rama as the deity of the Treta Yuga, the epoch in which the Ramayana unfolds. This makes it one of the very few temples in India dedicated to the Treta incarnation of Vishnu.

Here, devotees can feel the aura of ancient Ayodhya as described in the Ramayana—peaceful, prosperous, and filled with the divine presence of Shri Ram.

The Idols – Carved from a Single Black Stone

One of the most mesmerizing features of Treta Ke Thakur Temple is its set of ancient idols:
- Lord Rama
- Sita Mata
- Lakshman
- Hanuman

These murtis are believed to be carved from a single block of black sandstone, and legend says they were crafted not by human hands, but by divine beings themselves. Their beauty, symmetry, and ancient charm make them a centerpiece of devotion.

The idols are brought out for public viewing mainly on special occasions, such as Kartik Purnima, when thousands gather to witness them.

The Legendary Ashwamedha Yagna

According to tradition, this very spot is where Rama conducted the Ashwamedha Yagna after returning victorious from Lanka.

The ritual symbolized:
- Universal peace
- The establishment of dharma
- Rama's rightful sovereignty over the kingdoms

Treta Ke Thakur stands as a sacred reminder of this monumental Vedic event, making it a spiritually charged destination for devotees seeking blessings and peace.

Architecture & Atmosphere

Although not heavily ornate, the temple exudes an ancient, peaceful charm:
- Open courtyards facing the Saryu River
- Quiet sanctum with soft lighting
- Vedic chanting during special rituals
- The soothing river breeze adding to the divine ambience

This setting offers a perfect blend of spirituality and tranquillity for travelers.

Best Time to Visit

- Kartik Purnima – When the idols are brought out for public darshan
